# Shut-The-Box

Shut The Box is a single-player dice game where the objective is to "shut" or eliminate all the numbers on the board (from 1 to 9) by rolling two six-sided dice and selecting any combination of numbers that sum up to the value of the dice roll.

The player continues rolling and selecting numbers until:

All numbers are eliminated (the player wins), or
No combination of the remaining numbers adds up to the value of the dice roll (the player loses).
